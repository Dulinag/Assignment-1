      Leopards (Panthera pardus) are captivating big cats renowned for their distinctive and beautiful spotted coats, 
      featuring a pattern of rosettes that provides effective camouflage in a variety of habitats. Their adaptability 
      is remarkable, allowing them to thrive in diverse environments, ranging from dense forests and savannas to arid landscapes. 
      This adaptability has earned them the title of one of the most widespread big cat species, found across Africa and Asia.
      As solitary hunters, leopards are known for their elusive nature, relying on stealth and surprise to stalk and ambush 
      their prey. With a powerful build and sharp retractable claws, they are highly skilled climbers, often hauling their kills 
      into the safety of tree branches to avoid scavengers and other predators. This behavior also serves to protect their food 
      source and provides a strategic advantage in hunting.     </p>
