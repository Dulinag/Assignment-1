      African lions (Panthera leo) are renowned for their impressive 
      physical characteristics and social behavior. These big cats are 
      characterized by their tawny fur and the striking manes that adorn 
      the males, symbolizing strength and dominance. Lions are typically 
      found in the expansive savannas and grasslands of Africa, 
      where their prides, structured groups consisting of related 
      females, their offspring, and a coalition of males, thrive. These 
      apex predators exhibit a sophisticated social structure 
      within their prides, playing a crucial role in their survival and 
      hunting strategies. Cooperative hunting is a hallmark of their 
      behavior, as they work together to bring down prey, often relying
       on group coordination to increase their chances of success. This
        collaborative approach not only ensures a stable food supply for the pride but
         also reinforces the bonds within the group.    </p>
