      African lions, iconic symbols of strength and majesty, are large carnivores with distinctive manes in males. Living in social groups called prides, these apex predators are primarily found in the savannas and grasslands of Africa, where they work together in coordinated hunts to capture prey and maintain their dominance in the animal kingdom.
